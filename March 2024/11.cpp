/* Microsoft OA questions : 
Given a set of edges to form a graph network, now assign weights to the nodes such that total sum of weights of edges is maximum most . 

Given if the vertices set is : [[2,4] , [2,1] , [2,3] ,[3,1] ,[4,5]] , so degree of node 2 is maximum followed by degree of node 3 
and then degree of node 1 .

/* OA Questions : 
Q1 . Given a number X , find the next bigger number according to the digits 

Q2. Have the function StringReduction(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the smallest number you can get 
through the following reduction method. The method is: Only the letters a, b, and c will be given in str and you must take two
 different adjacent characters and replace it with the third. For example "ac" can be replaced with "b" but "aa" cannot be replaced 
 with anything. 
This method is done repeatedly until the string cannot be further reduced, and the length of the resulting string is to be outputted.
